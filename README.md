## Introduction
This website (https://midikaos.mnstrl.org/) is an archive of MIDI files collected by a music teacher over the years. Back in 1998, the CD-ROM was the ideal way to share the data, so he started to burn his collection and share it in his music school. The name of the project was Musikaos, it contained about 15000 MIDI files and some software to read, modify, and edit scores. The CD-ROM has been a small local success and has allowed the teachers of this school to expand their repertoire, print unpublished scores, and introduce their students to music from all over the world. Musikaos is now forgotten, most of the teachers have retired. I wished to pay tribute to this work and publish these files, to allow other amateur musicians to benefit from it.

## Midi files (SMF)
Quoting wikipedia, about MIDI:

> MIDI (an acronym for Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a technical standard that describes a communications protocol, digital interface, and electrical connectors that connect a wide variety of electronic musical instruments, computers, and related audio devices for playing, editing and recording music.

About Midi files specifically:

> The Standard MIDI File is a file format that provides a standardized way for music sequences to be saved, transported, and opened in other systems. The standard was developed and is maintained by the MMA, and usually uses a .mid extension.[43] The compact size of these files led to their widespread use in computers, mobile phone ringtones, webpage authoring and musical greeting cards. These files are intended for universal use and include such information as note values, timing and track names.
